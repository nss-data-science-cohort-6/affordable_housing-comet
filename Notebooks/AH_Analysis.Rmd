```

Lets read in some of the data provided to see what will be useful. 
```{r}
property_details <- read.csv(file = "../Data/property_details.csv")
LIHTC <- read.csv(file = "../Data/LIHTC.csv")
full_sales <- read.csv(file = "../Data/full_sales.csv")
filtered_sales <- read.csv(file = "../Data/filtered_sales.csv")
barnes <- read.csv(file = "../Data/barnes.csv")
asssesments <- read.csv(file = "../Data/assessments.csv")
```

We need to split the latitude and longitude of the property_details data frame and add them back to the original data frame as new columns. 
```{r}
split_coord <- str_split(str_extract(string = property_details$centroid, pattern =  "(?<=\\().*?(?=\\))"), ",", simplify = TRUE)
property_lat_long <- rename(as_tibble(split_coord), LAT = V2, LONG = V1)
property_details$LAT <- property_lat_long$LAT
property_details$LONG <- property_lat_long$LONG
```


Filter by LIH projects that were placed in service in the year 2000 or later. Barnes projects all were later than the year 2000. 
```{r}
#Extract year from HUD_ID column and add new column for year_in_service, then filter
LIHTC <- LIHTC %>% 
            mutate(year_in_service = strtoi(str_extract(HUD_ID, "\\d{4}"))) %>% 
            filter(year_in_service >= 2000)
```


Get point geometries for the properties and the LIH areas(including the Barnes LIH projects from barnes.csv).
```{r}
property_details_sf <- st_as_sf(property_details,
                                coords = c("LAT", "LONG"),
                                crs = 4326, agr = "identity")

LIHTC_sf <- st_as_sf(LIHTC, coords = c("LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"), crs = 4326, agr = "identity") %>% 
  select(PROJ_ADD, geometry) %>% 
  rename(address = PROJ_ADD)

barnes_sf <- st_as_sf(barnes, coords = c("lat", "lng"), crs = 4326, agr = "identity") %>% 
  select(Street.Address, geometry) %>% 
  rename(address = Street.Address)

#Get all of the LIHTC and Barnes projects into 1 sf variable 
all_LIH_projects_sf <-rbind(LIHTC_sf, barnes_sf)
```


1. Find the closest LIH development to each of the homes. Add new column with point geometry of the closest LIH project to property_details_sf data frame. 
```{r}
indeces_for_nearest_LIH <- st_nearest_feature(property_details_sf$geometry,
                                              all_LIH_projects_sf$geometry,
                                              check_crs = TRUE)

property_details_sf$closest_LIH <- all_LIH_projects_sf$geometry[indeces_for_nearest_LIH]
```


2. Calculate the distance from each homes closest development in miles. 
```{r}
dis_from_LIH_meters <- st_distance(x = property_details_sf$geometry, 
                                    y = property_details_sf$closest_LIH, 
                                    by_element = TRUE, 
                                    which = ifelse(isTRUE(st_is_longlat(property_details_sf$geometry)), "Great Circle", "Euclidean")
                                    )

property_details_sf$dis_from_LIH_miles <- drop_units(dis_from_LIH_meters/1609.34) #Meters in a Mile
```

3. Filter the homes down to those that are within one mile of an affordable housing development.
```{r}
property_details_sf <- property_details_sf %>% 
                          filter(dis_from_LIH_miles < 1)
```


4. For each remaining home, calculate a new column called "group", which is defined according to the following rules. Hint: Use the case_when         function to do this.
      "pre" - for homes where the distance is less than half a mile and whose sale date was 2-5 years prior to the input year
      "mid" - for homes where the distance is less than half a mile and whose sale date was 0-2 years prior to the input year
      "post" - for homes where the distance is less than half a mile and whose sale date was after the input year
      "outside" - for homes where the distance is more than half a mile and whose sale date was no more than 5 years prior to the input year
      "other" - All other rows
    
```{r}
property_details_sf <- merge(property_details_sf, filtered_sales, by.x = 'apn')
```


```{r}
 property_details_sf <- property_details_sf %>%
  mutate(
    group = case_when(
      (property_details_sf$dis_from_LIH_miles < 0.50) & 
        (property_details_sf$ownerdate >= ('2014-01-01')) &
        (property_details_sf$ownerdate <= ('2017-01-01')) ~ 'pre',
      (property_details_sf$dis_from_LIH_miles < 0.50) & 
        (property_details_sf$ownerdate >= ('2017-01-01')) & 
        (property_details_sf$ownerdate >= ('2019-01-01')) ~ 'mid',
      (property_details_sf$dis_from_LIH_miles < 0.50) & 
        (property_details_sf$ownerdate >= ('2019-01-01')) ~ 'post',
      (property_details_sf$dis_from_LIH_miles > 0.50) & 
        (property_details_sf$ownerdate >= ('2014-01-01')) ~ 'outside',
      TRUE ~ 'other'
      
    ))
         
```


5. Filter out all rows whose group is "other".

```{r}
property_details_sf <- property_details_sf %>% 
  filter(group != 'other')
```

6. Add an id column containing the id value for the development.
